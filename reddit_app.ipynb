Recall, if C is large, we do not regularize much (larger budget that the margin can be violated), leading to a more perfect classifier of our training data. Of course, there will be a trade off in overfitting and greater error due to higher variance. A smaller gamma helps with lower bias, by trading off with higher variance. Gamma = \"scale\", which uses `n_features` * `X.var()` tends to work well. "
