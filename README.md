What's the difference between a life pro tip, and one that is a bit more questionable? This can be sometimes a subtle difference, or a moral grey area to distinguish, even for humans.

Life Pro Tip:
A concise and specific tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.



Example: "If you want to learn a new language, figure out the 100 most frequently used words and start with them. Those words make up about 50% of everyday speech, and should be a very solid basis."

An Unethical Life Pro Tip is a tip that improves your life in a meaningful way, perhaps at the expense of others and/or with questionable legality. Due to their nature, do not actually follow any of these tipsâ€“they're just for fun.


Example: "Save business cards of people you don't like. If you ever hit a parked car accidentally, just write "sorry" on the back and leave it on the windshield."

I've collected over 1960 total top posts (web scrap) from 2 subreddits, and created a machine learning model using Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) to classify which subreddit a particular post belongs too. Can my model pick up on sarcasm, internet 'trolling', or tongue-in-cheek semantic of sentences? Probably not, but let's try. I hope you have as much fun playing with this, as I did making it.
